1. **Balanced Meals**: Aim for a balanced plate with protein, complex carbs, and plenty of veggies. This helps keep you full and satisfied.

2. **Regular Activity**: Find activities you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga. Consistency is key, so aim for regular movement.

3. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It helps with hunger management and overall well-being.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eating slowly can help you recognise when you're satisfied.

5. **Set Small Goals**: Focus on achievable micro habits, like adding an extra serving of vegetables to your meals.

1. **Successes This Week**:  
   * What types of movement have you enjoyed or felt good about?  
   * Were there any specific activities or routines that you found particularly motivating or satisfying?

2. **Challenges Overcome**:  
   * Did you face any obstacles that you managed to navigate successfully?  
   * How did you overcome them?

Now, let's plan for the next 7 days:

1. **Goals for the Week**:  
   * What specific movement goals would you like to set for yourself?  
   * Are there any new activities you'd like to try or continue with?

2. **Scheduling and Routine**:  
   * How can you fit these activities into your schedule?  
   * Would setting specific times or days help you stay consistent?

3. **Support and Motivation**:  
   * What can you do to keep yourself motivated throughout the week?  
   * Is there anyone who can support or join you in your activities?

Feel free to share your thoughts, and we can refine your plan together!",1346045_20250506_160909_a51dc2af

1. **Normalising Plateaux**:  
   * Weight loss often happens in steps rather than a continuous decline. It's normal to experience plateaux.

2. **Non-Scale Victories**:  
   * Have you noticed any changes in how your clothes fit, your energy levels, or your mood? These are important indicators of progress too!

3. **Reviewing Habits**:  
   * Are there any small changes you could make to your routine? Sometimes tweaking meal composition or adding a bit more movement can help.

4. **Stress and Sleep**:  
   * How have your stress levels and sleep been? Both can impact weight loss.

5. **Micro Habits**:  
   * Consider setting a small, achievable goal for the week. It could be as simple as adding an extra 5 minutes to your walk or trying a new vegetable.

Remember, you're doing great by staying committed. Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these areas further! üòä",1346045_20250506_160909_a51dc2af

The decision to stop medication is personal and depends on several factors, including your progress, goals, and any side effects you might be experiencing.

Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Consult with Your Clinician**: It's important to discuss your thoughts with your clinician. They can provide personalised advice based on your health and progress.

2. **Consider Your Goals**: Reflect on whether you've reached your weight loss or health goals and how you feel about maintaining them without medication.

3. **Evaluate Side Effects**: If side effects are a concern, your clinician can help weigh the benefits and drawbacks.

4. **Plan for Maintenance**: If you decide to stop, having a plan to maintain your progress through lifestyle changes is key.

Based on your description of the situation we are unable to determine if any medication was injected - the clinician I spoke to has advised that we should err on the side of caution and wait a week before you attempt to inject again, just to prevent the risk of any side effects that might occur, since you are on a higher dosage.

3. **Hydration**: Make sure you're drinking enough water, as it can help with metabolism and fullness.

4. **Sleep and Stress**: Are you getting enough rest and managing stress? Both can impact weight loss.

5. **Track Non-Scale Victories**: Keep an eye on other progress indicators like energy levels or clothing fit.

3. **Seated Leg Lifts**: Sit in a chair, extend one leg at a time, holding for a few seconds. This strengthens your thighs.

4. **Resistance Bands**: Use bands for gentle arm and leg exercises. They provide resistance without heavy weights.

5. **Ankle Circles**: While seated, rotate your ankles to improve flexibility and circulation.

1. **Include Protein in Every Meal**: Think about adding sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant-based options like beans and lentils.

1. **Balanced Plate Model**: Aim for half your plate to be non-starchy vegetables, a quarter protein, and a quarter complex carbs. This helps with fullness and nutrition.

2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink at least 6-8 cups of water daily. Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger.

3. **Regular Meals**: Try to eat at regular intervals to keep your metabolism steady and avoid extreme hunger.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and enjoy your meals.

5. **Track Progress**: Keep a log of your meals and activity. It helps identify patterns and areas for improvement.

6. **Stay Active**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga. Consistency is key.

7. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals. Celebrate each success, no matter how small.

8. **Sleep Well**: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep. It supports weight loss and overall health.

1. **Review Your Routine**: Have there been any changes in your eating or activity patterns recently?

2. **Mix Up Your Meals**: Sometimes, introducing new foods or changing meal timing can help. Have you tried incorporating different proteins or veggies?

3. **Increase Activity**: Adding a bit more movement, like a short walk or some light strength exercises, can make a difference.

4. **Focus on Non-Scale Victories**: Are there any other positive changes you've noticed, like energy levels or how your clothes fit?

1. **Adjust Your Meals**: Sometimes, small changes in your meal composition can help. Have you tried adding more protein or fibre to your meals?

2. **Change Up Your Exercise**: If you're doing the same workouts, your body might have adapted. Adding a new activity or increasing intensity slightly could help.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Paying close attention to hunger and fullness cues can make a big difference. Are there times when you eat out of habit rather than hunger?

4. **Hydration and Sleep**: Sometimes, focusing on getting enough water and quality sleep can help break a plateau.

1. **Review Your Routine**: Have there been any changes in your eating or activity patterns recently?

2. **Mix Up Your Meals**: Sometimes, introducing new foods or changing meal timing can help. Have you tried incorporating different proteins or veggies?

3. **Increase Activity**: Adding a bit more movement, like a short walk or some light strength exercises, can make a difference. How's your current activity level?

4. **Focus on Non-Scale Victories**: Remember, progress isn't just about the scale. How are your clothes fitting, or how's your energy level?

3. **Hydration and Sleep**: Ensure you're drinking enough water and getting quality sleep, as both can impact weight loss.

Here are a few steps you can take:

- Check Regulations: Before your flight, make sure to check the regulations of both your departure and arrival countries regarding the transportation of prescription medications. You can usually find this information on the website of the country‚Äôs health department or transportation authority.

- Prescription Documentation: Carry a copy of your prescription. This can be helpful in case you‚Äôre asked to provide documentation at security checkpoints.

- Packaging and Labels: Keep the medication in its original packaging with the prescription label intact. This helps to identify the medication and proves that it‚Äôs legally obtained. Always carry in your hand luggage.

- Security Checkpoint: When going through security, inform the security officers that you‚Äôre carrying prescription medication in your hand luggage. They may ask to inspect it separately from the rest of your belongings.

- Temperature: If you have used your pen already, this can be kept at room temperature for up to 30 days. If your medication is unused, you will need to ensure it is kept cold. You can use an insulin carrier bag for this.

- International Travel: If you‚Äôre flying internationally, be aware of any additional customs or import regulations that may apply. Some countries have strict rules regarding the importation of certain medications.

- Checking treatment: Always make sure you check the liquid is colourless or slightly yellow before each administration.",1643837_20250401_101529_849c3bd2

- Opening the Voy app

- Selecting ‚ÄúChange Dose‚Äù
- Choosing 7.5mg as your desired dose

**Potatoes:**
- Potatoes are a great source of complex carbohydrates and can definitely be part of a balanced diet.
- Opt for healthier cooking methods like baking, boiling, or roasting.
- Sweet potatoes are also a nutritious alternative, offering more fibre and vitamins.

**Portion Sizes:**
- **Balanced Plate Model:** Aim for 1/4 of your plate to be protein, 1/4 complex carbohydrates (like potatoes), and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables.
- **Reducing Portions:** Focus on smaller, balanced portions rather than cutting out entire food groups.
- **Visual Guide:** A portion of protein should be about the size of your palm, carbs like potatoes should be about the size of your fist, and fill the rest with veggies.

Adjusting portion sizes gradually can help you feel satisfied while supporting your weight loss goals. Let me know if you have more questions or need further guidance! üòä",1651292_20250323_100321_097bc578

1. **Check the Sugar Content:** Some flavoured yogurts can be high in added sugars. Look for options with lower sugar content or those sweetened with natural alternatives.

3. **Portion Control:** Enjoy it as part of a balanced meal or snack, perhaps with some nuts or fruit for added texture and nutrients.

4. **Alternative:** You can also add your own fruit or a drizzle of honey to plain Greek yogurt for a more controlled sweetness.

1. **Balanced Plate Approach**: Try to fill half your plate with veggies, a quarter with protein, and a quarter with whole grains or starchy foods. This helps keep things balanced.

2. **Mindful Eating**: Take your time to enjoy each bite and listen to your hunger cues. It‚Äôs okay to indulge a little, just be mindful of portion sizes.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water throughout the event. It can help you feel fuller and keep you hydrated.

4. **Plan Ahead**: If you know what‚Äôs being served, you can plan your meals earlier in the day to accommodate a treat or two.

5. **Social Focus**: Remember, the event is about enjoying the company as much as the food. Focus on conversations and having fun!

Do any of these resonate with you, or is there something specific you‚Äôre concerned about? üòä",1654174_20250320_170848_7ee6ead4

1. **Awareness**: Start by recognising when these thoughts pop up. You might say to yourself, ""Ah, there's that 'should' again.""

2. **Pause and Reflect**: Take a moment to pause. Ask yourself, ""Is this thought helping me or holding me back?""

3. **Reframe**: Try to reframe the thought. For example, change ""I should have done more"" to ""I'm doing my best, and that's enough.""

4. **Affirmation**: Use a positive affirmation to counteract the negative thought. Something like, ""I'm making progress at my own pace.""

5. **Action Plan**: Have a small, actionable step ready. It could be a quick walk, a breathing exercise, or jotting down a positive thought.

How does this approach sound to you?",1654174_20250426_094611_73ce759a

1. **Balanced Plate**: Aim for a balanced plate with 1/4 protein, 1/4 complex carbs, and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables. This helps keep you full and satisfied.

2. **Regular Meals**: Try to eat at regular intervals to keep your energy levels stable and avoid overeating.

3. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and enjoy each bite.

5. **Movement**: Incorporate regular physical activity that you enjoy. It could be walking, dancing, or anything that gets you moving.

6. **Track Progress**: Keep track of your progress, not just on the scale but also how your clothes fit and your energy levels.

7. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals rather than drastic changes.

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Break your goals into smaller, achievable steps. Celebrate each milestone to keep your motivation high.

2. **Prioritise Sleep**: Ensure you're getting enough rest. Quality sleep is crucial for energy and motivation.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can lead to fatigue.

4. **Balanced Nutrition**: Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein. This helps maintain energy levels.

5. **Regular Activity**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, like walking or dancing. It boosts energy and mood.

6. **Mindfulness Practices**: Try meditation or deep breathing exercises to reduce stress and increase focus.

7. **Positive Affirmations**: Remind yourself of your strengths and past successes. Positive self-talk can boost motivation.

1. **Stay Hydrated**: Aim for at least 2 litres of water daily. It helps with side effects and keeps you energised.

2. **Balanced Meals**: Follow the balanced plate model‚Äî1/4 protein, 1/4 complex carbs, and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables. This keeps you full and satisfied.

3. **Regular Activity**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, like walking or yoga. It boosts mood and energy.

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat mindfully and enjoy your meals.

5. **Rest Well**: Prioritise sleep to support your body's recovery and overall wellbeing.

6. **Manage Side Effects**: If you experience any, let me know, and we can explore solutions together.

-You‚Äôre continuing with your daily dog walks, aiming for about 45 minutes each day. Additionally, you‚Äôll start exploring local dance classes to find one that fits your schedule and interests, providing a fun and enjoyable way to incorporate more exercise into your routine.

I‚Äôll check in with you here every two weeks. If you ever hit a challenge or want to chat between those check‚Äëins, just let Coach Joy know‚Äîshe‚Äôs available 24/7 and will connect us when I‚Äôm around (Monday‚ÄìFriday, 9‚Äì5).

Can‚Äôt wait to see your progress‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this!

Hi there, just to clarify, the medication itself doesn‚Äôt directly cause weight loss. What it does is help reduce your appetite, which often leads to eating less and taking in fewer calories overall. That reduction in energy intake is what can help create the calorie deficit needed for weight loss.

If you‚Äôre not seeing progress on 2.5 mg, it‚Äôs likely that the current balance between your food intake and movement isn‚Äôt quite enough to shift the scales yet.  
  
That‚Äôs absolutely something we can work on together. Would you mind letting me know roughly how many steps you‚Äôre doing per day at the moment?  
  
¬†From there, we can start to look at some realistic tweaks to help move things in the right direction both nutrition and movement related. üòäÔ∏è",1834137_20250623_071512_0c8c3650

Cook some brown rice and top it with roasted or steamed veggies (think courgette, peppers, and green beans) and sliced chicken or sausages. A drizzle of a simple dressing or a squeeze of lemon can brighten it up.

3. **Pasta with Tomato and Veggie Sauce**  
Make a quick sauce by simmering canned tomatoes with garlic, onions, and your favourite veggies like spinach and mushrooms. Serve over wholegrain pasta with a sprinkle of cheese if you like.
