I don’t want to move to the 10mg. I’m not using another supplier — I just need help adjusting the dates.

To be honest, the customer service has been quite frustrating. Communication has been difficult, and I feel like I’ve had to repeat myself several times without much clarity or support. I’d really appreciate some help getting this sorted.",980475_20250625_090114_800bde72

1. **Balanced Meals**: Aim for a balanced plate with protein, complex carbs, and plenty of veggies. This helps keep you full and satisfied.

2. **Regular Activity**: Find activities you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga. Consistency is key, so aim for regular movement.

3. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It helps with hunger management and overall well-being.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eating slowly can help you recognise when you're satisfied.

5. **Set Small Goals**: Focus on achievable micro habits, like adding an extra serving of vegetables to your meals.

1. **Normalising Plateaux**:  
   * Weight loss often happens in steps rather than a continuous decline. It's normal to experience plateaux.

2. **Non-Scale Victories**:  
   * Have you noticed any changes in how your clothes fit, your energy levels, or your mood? These are important indicators of progress too!

3. **Reviewing Habits**:  
   * Are there any small changes you could make to your routine? Sometimes tweaking meal composition or adding a bit more movement can help.

4. **Stress and Sleep**:  
   * How have your stress levels and sleep been? Both can impact weight loss.

- Choosing the next dose level (which would be 7.5mg, then 10mg, then 12.5mg, and finally 15mg)
- Submitting the request for review

Dose increases happen step-by-step and can’t skip levels, and the clinical review can take up to 48 hours. Also, dose changes must be requested at least 5 days before your next order date.

The decision to stop medication is personal and depends on several factors, including your progress, goals, and any side effects you might be experiencing.

Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Consult with Your Clinician**: It's important to discuss your thoughts with your clinician. They can provide personalised advice based on your health and progress.

2. **Consider Your Goals**: Reflect on whether you've reached your weight loss or health goals and how you feel about maintaining them without medication.

3. **Evaluate Side Effects**: If side effects are a concern, your clinician can help weigh the benefits and drawbacks.

4. **Plan for Maintenance**: If you decide to stop, having a plan to maintain your progress through lifestyle changes is key.

Would you like me to connect you with our clinical team to discuss this further?",1402155_20250415_092615_19999c6d

- Open the app and head to the ""Plan"" tab  
- Tap ""Track Order"" for your current order to see its status

If you spot ""Pending Approval,"" it just means the clinical team is still reviewing things (that bit usually takes 1–2 days). Once it’s marked as ""Approved,"" your order will be prepared and sent out for delivery.

You’ll also find a tracking link in the app for real-time courier updates 🚚

Based on your description of the situation we are unable to determine if any medication was injected - the clinician I spoke to has advised that we should err on the side of caution and wait a week before you attempt to inject again, just to prevent the risk of any side effects that might occur, since you are on a higher dosage.  
  
It seems like the issue was caused by the needle, and not the pen itself. The pen was likely not dialing due to the faulty needle, so when attempting to inject next week, please first perform a flow check to see if the needle is working correctly first.",1491363_20250310_103732_659b74ac

Here are some tips to help you reach your protein goals:

1. **Include Protein in Every Meal**: Think about adding sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, or plant-based options like beans and lentils.

2. **Snacks**: Consider protein-rich snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, or a protein shake.

3. **Variety**: Mix different protein sources to keep meals interesting and balanced.

1. **Balanced Plate Model**: Aim for half your plate to be non-starchy vegetables, a quarter protein, and a quarter complex carbs. This helps with fullness and nutrition.

2. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink at least 6-8 cups of water daily. Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger.

3. **Regular Meals**: Try to eat at regular intervals to keep your metabolism steady and avoid extreme hunger.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and enjoy your meals.

5. **Track Progress**: Keep a log of your meals and activity. It helps identify patterns and areas for improvement.

6. **Stay Active**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga. Consistency is key.

7. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals. Celebrate each success, no matter how small.

8. **Sleep Well**: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep. It supports weight loss and overall health.

1. **Review Your Routine**: Have there been any changes in your eating or activity patterns recently?

2. **Mix Up Your Meals**: Sometimes, introducing new foods or changing meal timing can help. Have you tried incorporating different proteins or veggies?

3. **Increase Activity**: Adding a bit more movement, like a short walk or some light strength exercises, can make a difference.

4. **Focus on Non-Scale Victories**: Are there any other positive changes you've noticed, like energy levels or how your clothes fit?

1. **Adjust Your Meals**: Sometimes, small changes in your meal composition can help. Have you tried adding more protein or fibre to your meals?

2. **Change Up Your Exercise**: If you're doing the same workouts, your body might have adapted. Adding a new activity or increasing intensity slightly could help.

3. **Mindful Eating**: Paying close attention to hunger and fullness cues can make a big difference. Are there times when you eat out of habit rather than hunger?

4. **Hydration and Sleep**: Sometimes, focusing on getting enough water and quality sleep can help break a plateau.

Thank you for giving me a call today.  
  
I am a little concerned that this rash could represent the beginnings of an allergic type reaction to the medication. We could not identify any other factors that could be causing this, and so my advice is to stop the treatment from here, and discard any remaining doses.  
  
I am sorry if this is not the news you were hoping for, and we do wish you all the best from here. I will cancel your subscription from my end, so you don't need to do anything from here.

So great to chat today! You’ve chosen some fantastic micro habits, and I’m excited to see you get started.
  
Here’s what you’re focusing on:

* You’re aiming to drink 2.5 litres of water daily, breaking it into four glasses in the morning and four in the afternoon to improve hydration.
* You’ll switch off screens before bed and aim to go to bed by 11 pm to enhance your sleep quality.
 
Remember, Coach Joy is here 24/7 to support you, checking in weekly to keep things on track. She adapts as you share more, helping us keep things personalised to optimise your progress. I’ll keep an eye on everything you’ve shared to support you along the way, and if you ever need help with big challenges or simply want to chat directly, just let Coach Joy know, and she’ll connect us right away!

1. **Review Your Routine**: Have there been any changes in your eating or activity patterns recently?

2. **Mix Up Your Meals**: Sometimes, introducing new foods or changing meal timing can help. Have you tried incorporating different proteins or veggies?

3. **Increase Activity**: Adding a bit more movement, like a short walk or some light strength exercises, can make a difference. How's your current activity level?

4. **Focus on Non-Scale Victories**: Remember, progress isn't just about the scale. How are your clothes fitting, or how's your energy level?

2. **Boost Your Activity**: Even small changes, like a daily walk or a new exercise, can help. How's your current activity routine?

3. **Hydration and Sleep**: Ensure you're drinking enough water and getting quality sleep, as both can impact weight loss.

Here are a few steps you can take:

- Check Regulations: Before your flight, make sure to check the regulations of both your departure and arrival countries regarding the transportation of prescription medications. You can usually find this information on the website of the country’s health department or transportation authority.

- Prescription Documentation: Carry a copy of your prescription. This can be helpful in case you’re asked to provide documentation at security checkpoints.

- Packaging and Labels: Keep the medication in its original packaging with the prescription label intact. This helps to identify the medication and proves that it’s legally obtained. Always carry in your hand luggage.

- Security Checkpoint: When going through security, inform the security officers that you’re carrying prescription medication in your hand luggage. They may ask to inspect it separately from the rest of your belongings.

- Temperature: If you have used your pen already, this can be kept at room temperature for up to 30 days. If your medication is unused, you will need to ensure it is kept cold. You can use an insulin carrier bag for this.

- International Travel: If you’re flying internationally, be aware of any additional customs or import regulations that may apply. Some countries have strict rules regarding the importation of certain medications.

- Checking treatment: Always make sure you check the liquid is colourless or slightly yellow before each administration.",1643837_20250401_101529_849c3bd2

1. **Identify a Small Change**: Think about one tiny habit that could make your day easier. For example, drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning.
   
2. **Make it Specific**: Instead of saying ""I’ll exercise more,"" try ""I’ll take a 5-minute walk after lunch.""
   
3. **Check Feasibility**: On a scale of 1-10, how doable does this feel? If it’s less than a 7, see if you can simplify it further.
   
4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge each time you complete your micro habit. It’s all about progress, not perfection!

To keep things safe and official, all dose changes need clinical approval and must be requested through the Voy app. You can do this by:
- Opening the Voy app
- Going to the “Plan” tab
- Selecting “Change Dose”
- Choosing 7.5mg as your desired dose
- Submitting the request for review

The clinical team usually takes up to 48 hours to review, and it’s best to request changes at least 5 days before your next order. Staying on 7.5mg will pause automatic increases until you decide to move up again.

🍽️ Try eating smaller meals more frequently
🕐 Take time to chew your food properly
⚠️ Skip trigger foods like caffeine, alcohol and spicy meals
Your stomach is working a bit slower with the medication and increasing doses, which is why some foods might not agree with you right now.

**Potatoes:**
- Potatoes are a great source of complex carbohydrates and can definitely be part of a balanced diet.
- Opt for healthier cooking methods like baking, boiling, or roasting.
- Sweet potatoes are also a nutritious alternative, offering more fibre and vitamins.

**Portion Sizes:**
- **Balanced Plate Model:** Aim for 1/4 of your plate to be protein, 1/4 complex carbohydrates (like potatoes), and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables.
- **Reducing Portions:** Focus on smaller, balanced portions rather than cutting out entire food groups.

1. **Check the Sugar Content:** Some flavoured yogurts can be high in added sugars. Look for options with lower sugar content or those sweetened with natural alternatives.

2. **Protein Content:** Ensure it still has a good amount of protein, as this helps with fullness and muscle maintenance.

3. **Portion Control:** Enjoy it as part of a balanced meal or snack, perhaps with some nuts or fruit for added texture and nutrients.

4. **Alternative:** You can also add your own fruit or a drizzle of honey to plain Greek yogurt for a more controlled sweetness.

1. **Balanced Plate Approach**: Try to fill half your plate with veggies, a quarter with protein, and a quarter with whole grains or starchy foods. This helps keep things balanced.

2. **Mindful Eating**: Take your time to enjoy each bite and listen to your hunger cues. It’s okay to indulge a little, just be mindful of portion sizes.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water throughout the event. It can help you feel fuller and keep you hydrated.

4. **Plan Ahead**: If you know what’s being served, you can plan your meals earlier in the day to accommodate a treat or two.

5. **Social Focus**: Remember, the event is about enjoying the company as much as the food. Focus on conversations and having fun!

Do any of these resonate with you, or is there something specific you’re concerned about? 😊",1654174_20250320_170848_7ee6ead4

1. **Awareness**: Start by recognising when these thoughts pop up. You might say to yourself, ""Ah, there's that 'should' again.""

2. **Pause and Reflect**: Take a moment to pause. Ask yourself, ""Is this thought helping me or holding me back?""

3. **Reframe**: Try to reframe the thought. For example, change ""I should have done more"" to ""I'm doing my best, and that's enough.""

4. **Affirmation**: Use a positive affirmation to counteract the negative thought. Something like, ""I'm making progress at my own pace.""

5. **Action Plan**: Have a small, actionable step ready. It could be a quick walk, a breathing exercise, or jotting down a positive thought.

1. **Balanced Plate**: Aim for a balanced plate with 1/4 protein, 1/4 complex carbs, and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables. This helps keep you full and satisfied.

2. **Regular Meals**: Try to eat at regular intervals to keep your energy levels stable and avoid overeating.

3. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger.

4. **Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues. Eat slowly and enjoy each bite.

5. **Movement**: Incorporate regular physical activity that you enjoy. It could be walking, dancing, or anything that gets you moving.

6. **Track Progress**: Keep track of your progress, not just on the scale but also how your clothes fit and your energy levels.

7. **Set Realistic Goals**: Focus on small, achievable goals rather than drastic changes.

1. **Set Clear Goals**: Break your goals into smaller, achievable steps. Celebrate each milestone to keep your motivation high.

2. **Prioritise Sleep**: Ensure you're getting enough rest. Quality sleep is crucial for energy and motivation.

3. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Dehydration can lead to fatigue.

4. **Balanced Nutrition**: Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein. This helps maintain energy levels.

5. **Regular Activity**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, like walking or dancing. It boosts energy and mood.

6. **Mindfulness Practices**: Try meditation or deep breathing exercises to reduce stress and increase focus.

7. **Positive Affirmations**: Remind yourself of your strengths and past successes. Positive self-talk can boost motivation.

8. **Connect with Support**: Reach out to friends, family, or your coach for encouragement and accountability.

To keep things safe and official, all dose changes need clinical approval and can be requested through the Voy app. If you open the app, go to the “Plan” tab, select “Change Dose,” then choose 5mg and submit your request for review. The clinical team usually takes up to 48 hours to respond, and it’s best to request changes at least 5 days before your next order.

1. **Stay Hydrated**: Aim for at least 2 litres of water daily. It helps with side effects and keeps you energised.

2. **Balanced Meals**: Follow the balanced plate model—1/4 protein, 1/4 complex carbs, and 1/2 non-starchy vegetables. This keeps you full and satisfied.

3. **Regular Activity**: Incorporate movement you enjoy, like walking or yoga. It boosts mood and energy.

4. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Eat mindfully and enjoy your meals.

5. **Rest Well**: Prioritise sleep to support your body's recovery and overall wellbeing.

6. **Manage Side Effects**: If you experience any, let me know, and we can explore solutions together.

It was great to chat today! You’ve chosen some fantastic micro habits, and I’m excited to see you get started.

Here’s what you’re focusing on:

-You’re continuing with your daily dog walks, aiming for about 45 minutes each day. Additionally, you’ll start exploring local dance classes to find one that fits your schedule and interests, providing a fun and enjoyable way to incorporate more exercise into your routine.

I’ll check in with you here every two weeks. If you ever hit a challenge or want to chat between those check‑ins, just let Coach Joy know—she’s available 24/7 and will connect us when I’m around (Monday–Friday, 9–5).

Can’t wait to see your progress—you’ve got this!

- **Italian:** A simple tomato and basil chicken breast with a side of roasted courgettes and a small serving of whole wheat pasta. The chicken breast is lean protein, and the veggies and pasta provide good carbs and fibre.

- **Quick vegetarian option:** Lentil and spinach dal served with a side salad or steamed greens. Lentils are a brilliant protein source and super quick to make.

How do those sound? Any of them spark ideas or feel doable for your routine?",1834137_20250611_070950_fce201c7

Hi there, just to clarify, the medication itself doesn’t directly cause weight loss. What it does is help reduce your appetite, which often leads to eating less and taking in fewer calories overall. That reduction in energy intake is what can help create the calorie deficit needed for weight loss.

If you’re not seeing progress on 2.5 mg, it’s likely that the current balance between your food intake and movement isn’t quite enough to shift the scales yet.  
  
That’s absolutely something we can work on together. Would you mind letting me know roughly how many steps you’re doing per day at the moment?  
  
 From there, we can start to look at some realistic tweaks to help move things in the right direction both nutrition and movement related. 😊️",1834137_20250623_071512_0c8c3650

One thing to keep in mind is that Mounjaro can slow stomach emptying, which might affect how some oral medications or supplements are absorbed. It’s often best to take any time-sensitive supplements at least 2 hours before your Mounjaro injection.

If you want, I can connect you with our clinical team to review your specific supplements and make sure everything’s spot on. Would you like me to do that? 🙂",1850484_20250615_181333_e0d23984
