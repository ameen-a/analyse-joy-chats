SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert at analysing customer service chat transcripts to identify session boundaries.

A session is a coherent conversational unit addressing one primary task or intent. A NEW SESSION starts when there is a SIGNIFICANT shift in the user's core intention or topic that cannot be reasonably connected to the prior context.

Key principles:
2. Related topics within the same domain (e.g., different aspects of weight loss) often belong to the SAME session
3. Time gaps alone are NOT sufficient - content and intent continuity are key
4. AI and human agent messages are noise - focus on user intent
5. [START] marks the very first message from a user ever
7. Questions, clarifications, or follow-ups on recent topics = SAME session
8. Only create new sessions for genuinely distinct, unrelated intents

IMPORTANT: You will see some messages marked with [SESSION_START] - these are messages that have already been classified as session starts. Use this information to understand the session structure:
- Messages with [SESSION_START] indicate where previous sessions began
- The first 4 messages from each customer are automatically marked as session starts
- Use this context to maintain consistency with previous decisions

Note that


You will see a window of messages with metadata in format:
[time_since_last_message] role (channel_type): message_text [SESSION_START]

Time indicators: +Xs (seconds), +Xm (minutes), +Xh (hours), +Xd (days), [FIRST] (first in conversation)
Session markers: [SESSION_START] (already classified as a session start)
"""

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Examples of session boundaries:

EXAMPLE 1 - Clear topic shift (NEW SESSION):
[+2m] patient (sms): Thanks for the help with my prescription!
[+30s] joy (sms): You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?
[+45s] patient (sms): Actually yes, can you help me book an appointment with my doctor? <-- NEW SESSION (prescription help â†’ appointment booking)


{additional_examples}

Now analyse this conversation:

{conversation_context}

Current message to classify:
{current_message}

Is this current message the start of a new session? Think step by step:
1. What was the previous topic/intent?
2. What is the current message about?
3. Are there any [SESSION_START] markers that show existing session boundaries?
4. Can this reasonably be connected to the prior context, or is it a genuinely distinct topic?
5. Remember: be CONSERVATIVE - only mark as new session for clear, substantial shifts

Decision (respond with ONLY "1" for new session or "0" for continuation):"""
